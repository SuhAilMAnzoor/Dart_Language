// 2) Equlity & Relational Operators:
//1st) Greater Than( >  )  , Less Than  ( < )  , Greater Than or Equal to  ( >= )  ,   Less Than or equal to ( <= )
//2nd) Equlity   ( == )  ,   Not Equal  ( != )
// both are clear because we have worked a lot with geater less than or eqal to

void main() {
  // Program 4  with less than or equal to
  int age = 19;
  bool Reesult = age <=
      18; // false , here age is greater than 18 so we compare 18 with 19 so it is false 18 is less than 19
  print(Reesult);

  // Program 5   with not equal
  int age1 = 19;
  bool resultt = age1 != 18;
  print(resultt);
}
